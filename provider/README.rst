django-cas-provider
===================

OVERVIEW
=========

django-cas-provider is a provider for the `Central Authentication Service <http://jasig.org/cas>`_. It supports CAS version 1.0 and parts of CAS version 2.0 protocol. It allows remote services to authenticate users for the purposes of Single Sign-On (SSO). For example, a user logs into a CAS server 
(provided by django-cas-provider) and can then access other services (such as email, calendar, etc) without re-entering her password for each service. For more details, see the `CAS wiki <http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/display/CAS/Home>`_ and `Single Sign-On on Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Sign_On>`_.
